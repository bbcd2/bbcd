This repository contains our anon key for the database. [Here's why that's okay!](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys#the-anon-key)
If you wish to develop locally you must modify the backend URLs to one(s) you control. In the future I will generalise the repository so this can be done via environment variables or .env.
