Downloads programmes from BBC iPlayer MPD feeds. Current deployment can be found at https://bbcd.kattschan.co.uk.

If you wish to develop locally you must modify the backend URLs to one(s) you control. In the future I will generalise the repository so this can be done via environment variables or .env.
